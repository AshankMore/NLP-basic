# NLP_practice
Natural Language Processing, which basically consists of combining machine learning techniques with text, and using math and statistics to get that text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand!<br>
These are some of the successful implementations of Natural Language Processing (NLP):<br>
- Search engines. Google search engine understands that you are a tech guy so it shows you results related to you.<br>
- Social websites feed like the Facebook news feed. The news feed algorithm understands your interests using natural language processing and shows you related Ads and posts more likely than other posts.<br>
- Speech engines like Apple Siri.<br>
- Spam filters like Google spam filters. It’s not just about the usual spam filtering, now spam filters understand what’s inside the email content and see if it’s a spam or not.<br>
